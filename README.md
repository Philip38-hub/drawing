# Drawing

**Drawing** is a simple Rust library for creating and manipulating basic shapes on a raster image. It allows you to draw points, lines, rectangles, triangles, and circles with customizable colors and sizes.

## Features

- Draw various shapes: points, lines, rectangles, triangles, and circles.
- Customize colors for each shape.
- Randomize shape properties such as position and size.
- Easy-to-use API for integrating drawing functionality into your Rust applications.

## Requirements

- Rust (stable)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)
